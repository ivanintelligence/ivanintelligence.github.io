<title>Forecasting Typhoon Trajectory Using Interpolation and Extrapolation</title>

A simple desktop application that predicts the next path of a typhoon based on observed data points of its previous trajectory. Python and PyQt were used for full-stack development. Although the forecasting is limited to historical path data and does not account for other factors influencing a typhoonâ€™s movement, the application is primarily designed to illustrate the concepts of interpolation and extrapolation.
