<title>The 10th International Conference of Next Generation Computing</title>

Presented my research titled “Innovative 3D Model Reconstruction from 2D Stereoscopic Plant Images with Investigation between YOLOv8 and Detectron2 AI Architectures for Plant Class Segmentation” as an oral presenter at The 10th International Conference on Next Generation Computing (ICNGC 2024), held at the Holy Angel University Auditorium, Angeles City, Philippines, in November 2024. The conference was organized by the Korean Institute of Next Generation Computing (KINGPC), a South Korea-based research organization dedicated to advancing research and development in emerging computing technologies.

The research solves a computer vision challenge of creating a 3D model of a plant from constrained stereo images for visualizing plant growth structures, that can be useful for plant phenotyping.

Awarded with Best Paper Award in Oral Session, recognized among 80 international research presenters.
