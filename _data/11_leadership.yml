    Presented and worked my research in machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision together with international students from Soonchunhyang University (SCH), South Korea, demonstrating my ability to build relationships, exchange ideas, and collaborate amidst language barriers.<br><br>
    This activity was part of SCH’s Cultural Internship Program, where SCH students visit partner universities abroad, including the University of San Carlos (USC) of the Philippines, for research exposure, cultural exchange, and academic collaboration.<br><br>
    The collaboration took place for 10 days (July 2-12, 2024) at the University of San Carlos, where I was one of the few selected undergraduate researchers to collaborate with the South Korean students. My engagement helped strengthened the partnership between the two universities and fulfill the program’s vision.
